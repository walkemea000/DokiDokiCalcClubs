  <p> <i> Welcome to the inner mechanisms of my mind  </i> The rules of the game are simple, you have joined the Calc club at your high school! In the club is your four biggest crushes: Tuan, Hannah, Jeffrey, and Kenu. To pursue a crush, you must have the corresponding attirbutes.
    There are five attributes: Smarts, Strength, Charm, Clutch and Courage. To gain attribute points you must do well in calc club, meaning you must correctly answer Calculus questions. Various scenes will occur which requires you to make choices. These response you put in to a choice will also apply to your attributes. Some resposnes require a certain level of attribute points to work. If you are good at calc you will most likely win. Why? Because when you are good at math you are always in "demand" ;)</p>
